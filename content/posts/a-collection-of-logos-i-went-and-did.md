Hello there,

I figured out how to make half-decent logos for the programs and projects I've
been involved in. I wanted to make a little gallery to celebrate them, because I think
they are kind of cool.

First up, we got the logos that I made for my main projects!

## [Lorikeet](https://rhysnewell.github.io/Lorikeet/)
![](/images/lorikeet_logo.png)

Lorikeet is the project I've been working on for the longest time. I love it, and I hate it. Mostly I love it, it
does a lot of cool stuff and has changed A LOT over the years. It's probably the most impressive piece of coding I'll
make for awhile, and it's all in Rust (I love rust. <3). It was also the first program I made a logo for! This logo is not
that first version... That first version will never again see the light of day. I like this version though,
mainly because the program I use (GIMP) tripped out a little bit and started making cool shadow effects.

## [Rosella](https://rhysnewell.github.io/rosella/)

I really like how the rosella logo turned out. The soft colours really vibe with me, it just looks so smooth. Also, the
background colours worked perfectly as they match the markings of the [Pale-headed Rosella](https://www.google.com/search?q=pale-headed+rosella&rlz=1C1GCEB_enAU909AU909&sxsrf=ALiCzsbze3TPniXB6KHoi0HoKhqnajiO-Q:1657881446555&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiKkc7V2fr4AhWcT2wGHXhZCYgQ_AUoAXoECCYQAw&biw=1849&bih=1021&dpr=1.35)
surprisingly well!

## [Aviary](https://rhysnewell.github.io/aviary/)
![](/images/aviary_logo.png)

This is my first attempt at a logo for aviary, I'm not entirely sold on this iteration so I may end up remaking this. This one
is perfectly fine though, IMO. I chose to use budgies because budgies are adorable, lovely, little critters.

Now we have all the logos I've made for other people! A.K.A my supervisor [Ben Woodcroft](https://github.com/wwood).

## [CoverM](https://github.com/wwood/coverm/)
![](/images/coverm.png)

A deviation away from the birds! CoverM! A really great tool created by Ben for calcualting coverage statistics across
metagenomes. This program was my first introduction to Rust, confused the hell out of me when I first dove into it but I learned
so much from it.

## [Galah](https://github.com/wwood/galah/)
![](/images/galah_logo.png)

More birds! Also the colours match again. Galahs are great, such cheeky birds. This Galah performs rapid genome dereplication. 
Like super rapid dereplication. Faster than any Galah has any right to be.

## [Kingfisher](https://github.com/wwood/kingfisher-download)
![](/images/kingfisher_logo.png)

Kingfisher was my favourite logo for awhile. I just love the action, how it seems alive and the colours are also
very pleasing to me. Good stuff. Kingfisher fetches and downloads samples from the SRA, like its fishing.

## Sandpiper
![](/images/sandpiper.png)
Finally, we have sandpiper! Which is probably now my favourite logo, I somehow managed to make it "beach" coloured. Pretty 
proud of this one. Sandpiper doesn't have a link yet, but it's going to be a real cool website that lets you explore
SRA metadata. It will pair really well with Kingfisher and SingleM.
