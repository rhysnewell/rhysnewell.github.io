I figured out how to make half-decent logos for the programs and projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in. I wanted to make a little gallery to celebrate them, because I think they are kind of cool.
First up, we got the logos that I made for my main projects!
Lorikeet Lorikeet is the project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the longest time. I love it, and I hate it. Mostly I love it, it does a lot of cool stuff and has changed A LOT over the years.</description></item></channel></rss>
