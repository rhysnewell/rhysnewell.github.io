<h1>About Rhys</h1>
</header>
<p>Rhys is a PhD candidate at the Centre for Microbiome Research, QUT, Australia. Rhys is a bioinformatician focussed on
the development and publication of computational algorithms and workflows. Rhys is fluent in a number of programming languages
including Rust, Python, and R as well various other workflow managers like Snakemake.</p>
<p>Rhys completed his Bachelor of Science (Hons I) at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. His undergraduate
majors were genetics and ecology, where he was exposed to bioinformatics and other mystical ecological and genetic data analysis
techniques through Assoc. Prof. Mikael Boden. Rhys then completed his Honours in the Boden lab where he wrote and published
the tool <a href=https://github.com/rhysnewell/chip-r>ChIP-R</a>.</p>
<p>Wanting to combine his passion for ecology with his amazement with genetics and bioinformatics Rhys then applied for
a PhD under Dr. Ben Woodcroft and Prof. Gene Tyson with Assoc. Prof Mikael Boden as a secondary supervisor. At the time, Tyson and
Woodcroft were at that time a part of the Australian Centre for Ecogenomics at the University of Queensland.
During his PhD, Tyson, Woodcroft, and many others began a new centre at QUT called the Centre for Microbiome Research. Rhys was
involved in the establishment of this new centre and was partially responsible for the transfer of the hordes of data accumulated
from various metagenomic studies.</p>
<p>Rhys is currently in the process of finishing up his PhD, where is his thesis is focussed on the development of three
primary tools: <a href=https://rhysnewell.github.io/Lorikeet>Lorikeet</a>, <a href=https://rhysnewell.github.io/rosella>Rosella</a>, and
