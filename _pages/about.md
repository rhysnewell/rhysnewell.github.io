I am a PhD Candidate at the Australian Centre for Ecogenomcis. My main work focusses on the development of bioinformatic techniques and tools, and integration of metagenomic and metabolomic.

Current Projects
================
Lorikeet - Part of a larger suite of tools aiming to infer strain-level genotypes of microbial community members. Currently Lorikeet can identify potential polymorphisms along a contig/scaffold and the minimum number of genotypes possibly associated with that variant. Additionally, Lorikeet can produce contig statistics which will be incorporated into binning processes that will be soon added to the Lorikeet pipeline.
ChIP-R - Analysis of the reproducibility of ChIP-seq peaks in the presence of multiple replicates using peak fragmentations and the rank product statistic.

Additionally, many other projects are under development and will be added here when I feel like they have earned a name :)
